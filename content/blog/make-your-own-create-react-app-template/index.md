Create-react-app is a great utility to start coding a React app with very little configuration.

BUT the default boilerplate is to educate beginners only (ex: CSS), not very useful

* Delete the CSS files
* Delete the Service Worker
* Create `components` and `pages` folders
* Setup ESLint
* Setup Prettier via ESLint
* Install React Router
* Install Styled Components
* Reset or Normalize CSS via styled components

How to do it step by step

Link to my config

Plug the backticks article once it's up

Also do the same thing for ESLint (like wesbos did). NPM allows you to reuse your code easily, and share it with JS community.
